## Mod Overview

This mod lets you make your playthrough more challenging by setting skill caps, modifying skill experience, and more!

## Features

**Skill Level Cap Options** Set skill level caps for your major, minor, and miscellaneous skills. You can also have your maximum skill levels reduced based on your class, favored attributes, and race!

**Skill Experience Options** Modify skill experience gain. You can decrease or increase the gained skill experience!

**And more!**

### Skill Cap Options

You can set skill level caps for major, minor, and miscellaneous skills. By default, the maximum levels are set to 100 for major skills, 75 for minor skills, and 35 for miscellaneous skills.

ðŸ Š **Please note:** This mod doesn't let you remove skill caps, as this is not possible natively in OpenMW. Mods that accomplish this do so by using skill fortification effects. This mod is not compatible with these.

You can also have your class specialization, favored attributes, and race skill bonuses further limit your maximum skill levels:
- Skills that don't match your specialization will have reduced maximum levels
- Skills not governed by your favored attributes will also have reduced maximum levels
- Skills without a racial bonus will receive reduced maximum levels (the bonus amount doesn't matter - only whether there is a bonus or not)

You can also disable skill increases via trainers or books!

### Skill Experience Options

**Global Multiplier:** A flat multiplier you can use to increase or decrease experience gain for your skills.

**Diminishing returns:** The higher your skill levels, the lower the experience gain for each skill. You can further modify this effect with a multiplier.

You can also completely disable skill experience gain!

### More Options!

**Level Up Progress Limit:** You can have skills stop leveling up once your character has gained enough progress for a new level. Rest and meditate to continue improving your skills!

For more insights, you can enable debug info that gets written to the log when loading the game (F10).

All options can be toggled and modified in the mod settings!
