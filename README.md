## Mod Overview

This mod lets you make your playthrough more challenging by setting skills caps, modifying gained skill experience and more!

## Features

**Skill Cap Options** Set skill level cap for your major, minor and miscellaneous skills. You can further have your maximum skill levels be reduced based on your class, favored attributes and race!

**Skill Experience Options** Modify the gained experience. You can decrease or increase the skill experience gain!

**And more!**

### Skill Cap Options

You may set skill level caps for major, minor and and miscellaneous skills. By default, the maximum levels are set to 100 for major skills, 75 for minor skills, and 35 for miscellaneous skills.

ðŸ Š Please note: This mod doesn't let you remove skill caps, this is not possible natively in OpenMW. Mods that do that accomplish that with by using skill fortification effects. This mod is not compatible with that.

You may also have your class specialization, favored attributes, and race skill bonus further limit your maximum skill levels. Skills that do not match your specialization will have a reduced maximum level. Skills not governed by your favored attributes will also have a reduced maximum level. Also, skills not matching a skill bonus from your chosen Race will also receive a reduced maximum skill level. The skill bonus amount doesn't matter, only if there is a bonus or not.

### Skill Experience Options

Global Multiplier: A flat multiplier you can use to increase or descrease the experience gain for your skills.

Diminishing returns: The higher the level of your skills, the lower the experience gain for each skills. You can further modify that effect with a multiplier.

### More Options!

As an additional feature, skills will stop leveling up once the character gained enough progress for a new level. Rest and meditate to continue improving your skills.

All options can be toggled and modified in the mod settings!

### Too complicated?

To get a better overview on how the skill caps and multipliers play out, activate "Show Debug Info" in the configuration, save the game, then restart. Open the ingame log with F10 - you'll see an overview over your various calculated maximum skill levels and experience gain multipliers.

I also plan an ingame overview in a future release.

*OpenMW 0.49 or newer is required, incompatible with NCGDMW.*

*I hope you'll enjoy my mod!*
