Configurable class and race based skill level limits.

## Features

This mod sets skill level limits based on whether the skills are major, minor, or miscellaneous. By default, the maximum level limits are set to 100 for major skills, 75 for minor skills, and 35 for miscellaneous skills.

Your class specialization, favored attributes and race modify the maximum skill level. Skills that do not match your specialization will have a reduced maximum level based on a configurable malus. Skills not governed by your favored attributes will also have a reduced maximum level according to a configurable malus. Also, skills not matching a skill bonus from your chosen race will also receive a reduced maximum skill level. The skill bonus amount doesn't matter, only if there is a bonus or not.

As an additional feature, skills will stop levelling up once the character gained enough progress for a new level. Rest and meditate so you can progress on improving your skills. 

All features are toggleable and customizable through the configuration menu. This mod works with vanilla and custom classes.

## Calculation examples

Here are some examples of how specialization and favored attributes affect the maximum skill level:

* An **Orc** **Warrior** uses Combat as specialization and Strength and Endurance as favored attributes. Heavy Armor is a major skill, governed by Endurance, and is from the Combat specialization. Also, orcs receive a bonus on heavy armor. The orc warrior will be able to reach level 100 in Heavy Armor due to the skill being a perfect match with its class and race.
* An **Imperial** **Acrobat** uses Stealth as specialization and Agility and Endurance as favored attributes. Unarmored is a major skill, yet is governed by Speed, and is from the Magic specialization. The maximum skill level for Unarmored is reduced to 85, down from 100, since it doesn’t share a governed attribute (-5), specialization (-5) with its class. Also, the imperial doesn't receive a bonus for Unarmored. (-5)
* A **Nord** **Witchhunter** uses Magic as specialization and Intelligence and Agility as favored attributes. Mysticism is a minor skill, yet is governed by Willpower. The maximum skill level for Mysticism is reduced to 65, down from 75, since it doesn’t share a governed attribute (-5). Also, the nord doesn't receive a bonus for Mysticism. (-5)
* A **Wood Elf** **Thief** uses Stealth as specialization and Speed and Agility as favored attributes. Axe is a miscellaneous skill, governed by Strength, and is from the Combat specialization. The maximum skill level for Axe is reduced to 20, down from 35, since it doesn’t share a governed attribute (-5) or specialization (-5) with its class. Also, the wood elf doesn't receive a bonus for Axe. (-5)

## Recommendations

I recommend using this mod together with [“Class Restricted Leveling”](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/54832).
